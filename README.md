# Project3

# My program is a game that allows the user to perform a set of Linux Administration tasks based on their selection out of 7 (tentative) options
# 
#
# Options:
#
# 1. List all the files of a directory and its subdirectories. Requires a full path to work correctly. Ex: home/neils7/projects
#    Cases: No entry: List the files of the current working directory and all subdirectories
#           Invalid directory: Message indicating invalid directory and prompt user if they want to continue the game.
#
# 2. Find the number of files in a directory and all its subdirectories. Requires a full path to work correctly. Ex: home/neils7/projects
#    Cases: No entry: Count the number of files of the current working directory and all subdirectories
#           Invalid directory: Message indicating invalid directory and prompt user if they want to continue the game.
#
# 3. Find the permissions of all files in a directory and all its subdirectories. Requires a full path to work correctly. Ex: home/neils7/projects
#    Cases: No entry: Finds the permissions of the files of the current working directory and all subdirectories
#           Invalid directory: Message indicating invalid directory and prompt user if they want to continue the game.
#
# 4. Change the permissions of a file. User is asked to enter the 3-digit code to change the permissions of the file ex: '777'. After changing file permissions, call 'ls' to list
#    the file and its new permissions Requires a full path to work correctly. Ex: home/neils7/projects/project3.txt
#    Cases: No entry: Display error message and ask user if they want to continue the game.
#           Invalid file (file not found): Message indicating invalid file and prompt user if they want to continue the game.
